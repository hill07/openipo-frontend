        content: `
            <p>An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is a transformative event for any company. In India, the process is strictly regulated by SEBI to ensure transparency. But <strong>how does an IPO work</strong>? It starts with the company appointing merchant bankers and filing a draft prospectus (DRHP).</p>

            <p>After the bidding window closes, the registrar processes the applications. The final step is the listing on NSE and BSE. Keep an eye on the <a href="/">IPO</a> calendar for the latest opportunities.</p>
